# test-project

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: 22.13.1

## Project setup
## Why use --legacy-peer-deps? This flag is used because Vue 2 relies on older peer dependencies that may conflict with the latest versions of some packages. By using --legacy-peer-deps, npm bypasses strict dependency checks, allowing a smooth installation process without breaking compatibility.
```

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
